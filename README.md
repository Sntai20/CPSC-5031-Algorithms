# CPSC-5031-Algorithms
Algorithms play the central role in both the science and practice of computing. In this course, we learn different algorithm design techniques, including brute force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-and-conquer, transform-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy, and parallel algorithms. Different data structures are also discussed in these algorithm design techniques. In addition, analysis of algorithm efficiency and limitations of algorithm power are introduced.

## sorting.py
This program is instrumented to return the number of comparisions made in the following functions.
- selection sort
- quick sort
- lomuto partition

The random sequence function is used to make a list of random integers of a given length.
