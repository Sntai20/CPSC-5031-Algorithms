# CPSC-5031-Algorithms

Algorithms play the central role in both the science and practice of computing. In this course, we learn different algorithm design techniques, including brute force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-and-conquer, transform-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy, and parallel algorithms. Different data structures are also discussed in these algorithm design techniques. In addition, analysis of algorithm efficiency and limitations of algorithm power are introduced.
